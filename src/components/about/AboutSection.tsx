            Hi, my name is Tareq Hasan and I am a Passionate and highly skilled
            in web development, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise in
            a range of technologies. My skills span from front-end to back-end,
            making me a versatile full-stack developer. With a strong foundation
            in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I have worked extensively with modern
            libraries and frameworks such as React, Next.js, and React
            Bootstrap, crafting exceptional user experiences.
          </p>

            On the server side, I am proficient in Prisma, TypeScript, Node.js,
            and Express, delivering robust and efficient back-end solutions. I
            have experience with both NoSQL (MongoDB, Mongoose) and relational
            databases (PostgreSQL), and I can seamlessly integrate them into
            applications

          <br />
          <p>
            I am well-versed in Redux, offering state management solutions that
            enhance performance and maintainability. My coding expertise extends
            to C# and Java, and I apply object-oriented programming principles
            to create scalable and maintainable code. I am also proficient with
            tools like VSCode, Git, and various deployment platforms, including
            Firebase, Netlify, and Vercel.

            and a desire to always push the limits of what is possible. I am
            excited to see where my career takes me and am always open to new
